# FDPG Ontology

This project contains all the configuration, scripts, and resource files necessary to generate the **cohort selection**
and **data selection and extraction** ontologies used by the 
[FDPG+ Feasibility Backend](https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/feasibility-backend) to enable researchers
to identify cohorts and define data exports to power their research.
